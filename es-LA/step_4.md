    Type `gamesroom.html` as the page name:
    
    ![captura de pantalla](images/rooms-games-html.png)

+ The HTML for the **Games Room** is very similar to `tvroom.html` so **copy** that and **paste** it into `gamesroom.html`.
    
    Edit the highlighted items so they say Games not TV:

+ Your `gamesroom.html` now uses `gamesroom.css` which doesn't exist yet.
    
    Create `gamesroom.css` by clicking on the add page **+** button.

+ The CSS for the **Games Room** is very similar to `tvroom.css` so **copy** that and **paste** it into `gamesroom.css`.

    Not very exciting, but you can fix that in the next challenge.
