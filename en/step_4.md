	Type `gamesroom.html` as the page name:

+ The HTML for the __Games Room__ is very similar to `tvroom.html` so __copy__ that and __paste__ it into `gamesroom.html`.
	
	Edit the highlighted items so they say Games not TV:

+ Your `gamesroom.html` now uses `gamesroom.css` which doesn't exist yet. 

	Create `gamesroom.css` by clicking on the add page __+__ button. 

+ The CSS for the __Games Room__ is very similar to `tvroom.css` so __copy__ that and __paste__ it into `gamesroom.css`.

+ Test your project by clicking on the Games Room link

	The __Games Room__ should look like this:

	Not very exciting, but you can fix that in the next challenge.
