## Introduction

In this project, you'll create a set of linked rooms where each room is a different web page which you can decorate with HTML. 

<div class="trinket">
  <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/html/eab49f4f06?outputOnly=true&start=result" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
  <img src="images/rooms-hall-finished.png">
</div>

__Instructions__: Click the doors to move between rooms.

## Introduction:
In this project, children are introduced to multiple linked web pages in the same project each with their own CSS file. 


## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinket:

+ ['Linked Rooms' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-rooms](https://trinket.io/html/f1486ddb24)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Linked Rooms Finished' -- https://trinket.io/html/ba5d27ec68](https://trinket.io/html/eab49f4f06)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ linked-rooms/index.html
+ linked-rooms/style.css
+ linked-rooms/script.js
+ linked-rooms/prefixfree.js
+ linked-rooms/4 x .png images
+ template/template.html
+ template/style.css

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ linked-rooms-finished/index.html
+ linked-rooms-finished/style.css
+ linked-rooms-finished/script.js
+ linked-rooms-finished/prefixfree.js
+ linked-rooms-finished/4 x .png images

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
