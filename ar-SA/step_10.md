## Challenge: Make it yours!

Add more rooms to your project. Remember that you can use **copy** and **paste** to save time and then just change the things that need to be different.

For each room you will need to:

+ Create a `.html` file
+ Add door links to and from the new 'room'
+ Create a `.css` file with the styles for your new room and its doors

You can change the `background-color:` for each room. Click on the images icon to see the background images you can choose from:
