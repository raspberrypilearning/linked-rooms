## Challenge: Style and link the Games Room

Edit the HTML and CSS for the **Games Room** so that the webpage looks like this:

![स्क्रीनशॉट](images/rooms-games-challenge.png)

Hint: You'll need to change the background colour, font colour and border colour in `gamesroom.css`. The bright green colour is called `chartreuse`.

Hint: You'll need to add an `<a>` link in `gamesroom.html` which links to `index.html`.
